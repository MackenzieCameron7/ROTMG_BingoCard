 Bingo Card Generator for Realm of the Mad God.

Simple Bingo card generator containing images of equipment/items from the video game: "Realm of the Mad God".

as untiered items drop from whitebags. Helps Speed up the process.

want to include a shiny, without the tedium of getting specific shinies.

##Known bugs/Not working features
- Program freezing. Usually due to not enough error checking during random generation when the sum f the options
  selected do not add up to at least 25 images to be randomized.
- Features selected counter below the checklist does not update based on cheked boxes.
- Check boxes should have a number in parentheses to increase user experience to be able to know how many items a
  filter will add to generation
- "Export as png" still contains application borders when saved.

##Common Questions
Q:Why can I get a bingo card with 4 realm event whites (much rarer items to acquire)? It would take me ages to complete.
Q:Why can I get a bingo card with mostly shatters, moonlight vilage and oryx 3 items? It would be too hard.

A:Just generate another. I usually like to open a discussion about the generated bingo card with friends. Sometimes
items may be easier than usual to acquire in a timely fashion becasue of current events in the game. Sometimes an item
may be harder or easier to acquire based on player skill. I know I still cannot make it past second boss in the 
shatters dungeon, so I cannot get most of the items from that dungeon, whereas my friends can. On the matter of realm 
event whites I feel like it may cause an issue. They are very rare and may lead to many a bingo card re-creation, 
since they cannot be acquired in a timely fashion. Being able to filter out event whites and specific drops by dungeon
would prove to fix this issue or tagging items and only allowing a certain amount of them per card generated. These 
fixes would be for a future update.
